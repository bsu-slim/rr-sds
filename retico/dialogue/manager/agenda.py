"""
An agenda based dialogue manager that uses a stack structure only for immediate
answers to questions and otherwise decides the next dialogue act based on the
state of the agenda.

This dialogue manager also incorporates an ActGuider that looks at real life
data and tries to suggest dialogue acts that were already seen in the data
rather than completely 'artifical' ones.

The dialogue manager is modeled after the agenda-based user simulator described
in [Schatzmann et al., 2007] but adds the additional features of "act guidance"
and "field mentioning" to allows for a correct behaviour during dialogues that
incorporate dynamic turn taking.

The rules of the agenda-based dialogue manager are as follows:
    GREETING: Greet and check off potentially mentioned field (such as the
        interlocutors name)
    GOODBYE: Say goodbye
    PROVIDE_INFO: confirm and check off the information that was provided.
    PROVIDE_PARTIAL: confirm and check off the partial bit of information that
        was provided.
    REQUEST_INFO: provide the requested information regardless of the state of
        that field and check off that information
    OFFER_INFO: provide that information and mark it as checked.
    STALLING: do nothing
    REQUEST_CONFIRM: confirm the field that was requested
    CONFIRM: mark the field as confirmed
    MISUNDERSTANDING: repeat the field
    THANKS: utter welcome
    WELCOME: do nothing
